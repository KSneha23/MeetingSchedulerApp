## About the project:
The project explores the idea of creating a user-friendly and customizable Meeting Scheduler App. The developed Web App lets users collaborate on the site to seamlessly add/ view/ edit/ delete their events in a very convenient and efficient manner.  
  
  
All of the scheduled meetings can be viewed on a google-like calendar along with their details and links to join the meeting. Upon completion of the meeting, it can be striked off the list by checking a box next to it. The app also ensures safety and security of its users by dint of having a properly laid out login/signup schema. The app comes along with the facility of Login using Google without having the users to create an account beforehand. Not to forget, the app not only facilitates viewing or scheduling of meetings but is also designed to send meeting reminders to users at their provided mail accounts as and when they set it.  
  
  
This forms just a gist of the overall App. The User Interface and Navigation between pages have been set up keeping in mind the comfort of users, to provide them with an enjoyable experience. The web pages are made responsive to sooth the mobile / tablet users as well.

## Mentors and Team Members:
Heartfelt thanks and sincere gratitude to the mentors- Dipin Garg and Krishanu Saini for their continuing support and the most invaluable guidance throughout the development of the project. Their genuine and unwavering faith in the team members kept us going. Needless to say, their technical knacks in places where we found ourselves caught, helped us gear up and accomplish the project well.  
  
  
Team Members:  Khushi Verma, K Sneha, Mir Razee, Harshitha Budati  
  
  
All of the team members worked together on the project, most of the times work was divided among the four of us without any clear demarcation as everyone co-operated. Broadly speaking, Sneha created the initial schedular Express ejs files and set up navigation amongst them. A calendar was also added by her to make the page look better. Khushi created the Home page and Login/Signup React pages and set up the backend bone for the project using Node and Express. Calendar logic like display of events on the google-like calendar and other related settings were also incorporated by her. Mir handled the Meeting Reminder set up and working, also created structure for login page and worked on the calendar addition. Harshitha designed a signup page for the project and worked with the calendar design for the second calendar for display. With this team-work, the project was completed beautifully.
